### Overview
Barbiere Maestro is a website for a modern barbershop salon. The main goal is to create a simple and intuitive website based on a deep understanding of the target users. Users of the site can obtain detailed information about the services provided, about the experience of each barber, and also look at examples of barber's haircuts in photos to decide whether they want to use the services of this salon.

#### First Time User
- As a person who lives near a barbershop and looking for good barber service.
- As a person who is looking for clear information about the barbershop and services provided.
- As a person who prefer to make bookings digitally rather than speaking with others.

#### Returning User
- As a returning user, I would like to review all my previous barbershop appointments.
- As a returning user, who already has an account I would like quickly and easily make an appointment with a barber.
- As a returning user, I would like to see updates to the information on the site so that I can find something new and interesting for myself (for example, new modern haircuts).

### Strategy
Determining the best approach meant studying the needs of potential users. This included users logging in, quickly and easily booking appointments, reading, updating and deleting their appointments (CRUD). 
One of the main features of this website is the ability for the registered user to fill out and submit the booking form without refreshing the page. The form contains 3 dependent dropdown lists where the user can select the service he needs, the barber and the date and time of appointment.

#### Agile
The Agile methodology was used to plan the project. Github was used as the tool to demonstrate this. 

Projects were used to divide the project into three iterations with a simple [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/OlgaKuvs/projects/3/views/1).
To prioritize tasks [MoSCoW method](https://github.com/users/OlgaKuvs/projects/3/views/4) was used.

##### User Stories 
Issues were used to create User Stories with a custom templates for admin and user. I added the acceptance criteria and the tasks so I can track my work effectively. Once I completed a User Story I would move it from in progress to completed. 

- User Stories:
 
  - As a User I would like to examine the information on the home page about the services provided so that decide whether I want to use them. 
  - As a User I would like to create an account so that I can book an appointment.
  - As a User, I would like to log in, so that I can access my profile.
  - As a Registered User I would like to see a list of available services, including relevant details such as barber name, appointment date and time so that I can choose the options that suit me.
  - As a Registered User I would like to view my appointments so that I can keep track of my booking (CRUD).
  - As a Registered User I would like to edit my booking so that I can change the details (CRUD).
  - As a Registered User I would like to delete my booking so that I can cancel my appointment (CRUD).
  - As a Registered User, I want to receive a confirmation text message or email, so that I know my appointment has been successfully booked.
  - As a Registered User I would like to be able to make an appointment with any barber to get the opportunity to choose a wider range of dates and times.
  - As an Admin I would like to view the bookings so that I can manage the barber's timetable.
  - As an admin I would like to have an access to database data so that I can make necessary changes (CRUD).
